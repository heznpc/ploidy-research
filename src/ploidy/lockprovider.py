"""Lock provider abstraction for single-node and Redis-backed deployments.

The service has always used ``asyncio.Lock`` keyed by ``debate_id`` to
serialise concurrent writes within one process. That is correct for a
single replica but breaks the moment two pods handle requests for the
same debate.

``LockProvider`` factors that primitive out so deployments can pick an
implementation:

- :class:`AsyncLockProvider` — default; wraps ``asyncio.Lock`` exactly
  like before, one lock per debate, stored in a local dict.
- :class:`RedisLockProvider` — distributed lock via SET NX / DEL with a
  unique token, safe to hold across pods. Uses ``redis.asyncio``; the
  ``redis`` package is optional.

For multi-replica we also need a way to serialise the in-memory caches
(protocols/sessions/etc.) — that is out of scope for this module. The
first step is distributed locks; replicas that need shared caches must
either lazily rehydrate from the database or adopt sticky routing.
