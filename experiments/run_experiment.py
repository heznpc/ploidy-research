"""
Ploidy Experiment Runner
========================
Evaluates context-asymmetric debate across the Context Asymmetry Spectrum.

Uses `claude --print` CLI (no API key needed, uses Max/Pro subscription).
Each call = fresh session = perfect context isolation.

Methods (11):
  single          - Single session, full context
  second_opinion  - Two independent sessions, concatenated
  ccr             - CCR: deep produces, fresh reviews
  symmetric       - Symmetric debate (both full context)
  ploidy          - Asymmetric debate (deep vs fresh)
  self_consistency - 5 independent runs + majority vote (same token budget as ploidy)
  sf_passive      - Semi-Fresh (Passive): compressed summary in prompt
  sf_active       - Semi-Fresh (Active): summary available, must retrieve after independent analysis
  sf_selective    - Semi-Fresh (Selective): only failure/uncertainty info provided
  sf_passive_indep - Ablation: passive + independent-first instruction
  sf_passive_bottom - Ablation: passive with summary at bottom

Experimental Variables:
  --effort         Effort level (low/medium/high/max) — controls LLM reasoning depth
  --model          Model identifier
  --long           Use long-context tasks with anchoring biases

Usage:
    python experiments/run_experiment.py
    python experiments/run_experiment.py --tasks 0,1,2 --methods ploidy,single
    python experiments/run_experiment.py --long --effort high --methods single,ploidy,sf_active
    python experiments/run_experiment.py --long --effort-sweep   # Run all effort levels

    """Run experiments across languages for localization analysis.

    Tests whether linguistic framing affects information quality.
    When LLMs localize responses to feel natural in different languages,
    social/cultural context injection may distort technical findings.

    Hypotheses:
    - H1: Localized responses may euphemize or soften critical findings
    - H2: Hierarchical language norms (e.g., Korean keigo) may suppress
           challenges to established positions
    - H3: The information loss from localization interacts with context
           asymmetry — Fresh sessions may be more affected because they
           lack context to anchor technical terms
