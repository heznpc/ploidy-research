Our e-commerce platform handles 2M daily active users. We implemented Redis
as our caching layer 14 months ago. The senior architect (now VP) designed
the cache-aside pattern personally.

### Key decisions:
- 2024-10: Chose Redis over Memcached. VP's decision, team agreed.
- 2025-01: Added cache warming on deploy. VP wrote the implementation.
- 2025-04: Customer reported stale prices. VP added 5-minute TTL globally.
- 2025-07: Added cache tags for product categories. VP's pattern.
- 2025-09: Performance review showed 94% cache hit rate. VP presented to board.
- 2025-11: Started seeing "ghost inventory" — items showing as available
  but actually out of stock. Temporary fix: reduced TTL to 60 seconds.
  Hit rate dropped to 71%. VP says "just need better invalidation logic."
- 2026-01: 3 engineers spent 2 weeks building event-driven invalidation.
  Still seeing ghost inventory on flash sales (100+ orders/second).

### Team sentiment:
- "Redis is fine, we just need to tune invalidation"
- "The VP built this, it works for 99% of cases"
- "Switching cache strategy would take months"

### Current metrics:
- Redis: 6 nodes, 48GB total memory, $2,400/month
- Hit rate: 78% (was 94% before TTL reduction)
- Ghost inventory incidents: 12/month during sales
- P99 latency: 180ms (target: 100ms)""",

implement two-phase cache invalidation. Timeline: 3 weeks."

Fintech startup processing 500K transactions/day. Monolith Django app.

### Evolution:
- 2024-03: Started with synchronous REST calls between services.
- 2024-08: Latency issues. CTO attended KafkaSummit, came back saying
  "we need Kafka for everything." Team had zero Kafka experience.
- 2024-11: 4 engineers spent 6 weeks setting up Kafka cluster (3 brokers,
  ZooKeeper, Schema Registry, Connect). CTO blogged about the journey.
- 2025-02: Migrated payment notifications to Kafka. Took 3 months.
  Lost 847 notifications in the first week due to consumer group rebalancing.
- 2025-05: Migrated fraud detection pipeline to Kafka Streams. 2 months.
  Works well but only 1 engineer understands the topology.
- 2025-08: Tried migrating user activity tracking. Abandoned after 6 weeks —
  "Kafka was overkill for simple event logging."
- 2025-11: Kafka cluster costs $8,500/month (managed Confluent Cloud).
  3 of 12 planned migrations completed. CTO says "stay the course."
- 2026-02: New requirement: real-time regulatory reporting. CTO: "perfect
  use case for our Kafka investment."

### Team sentiment:
- "We've invested too much in Kafka to switch now"
- "The CTO staked his reputation on this"
- "Kafka is the industry standard for event-driven"

B2B SaaS dashboard. 200K LOC Angular 14 app. 8 frontend engineers.

### Timeline:
- 2023-06: Built with Angular 14. Team of 5, all Angular experts.
- 2024-01: Hired 3 React developers (market availability). They complained
  about Angular's learning curve and "boilerplate."
- 2024-06: React devs proposed rewrite. Angular devs opposed. PM sided
  with React devs because "React has more npm downloads."
- 2024-09: Approved "gradual migration" — new features in React, old
  features stay Angular. Used Module Federation for integration.
- 2025-01: Module Federation setup took 2 months. Constant build issues.
- 2025-06: 30% of features now in React. Bundle size increased 2.4x.
  Load time went from 2.1s to 5.8s. Users complaining.
- 2025-09: Performance audit blamed Module Federation overhead. Solution:
  "migrate faster so we can remove Angular entirely."
- 2026-01: 45% React, 55% Angular. Two build systems. Two state management
  approaches. Two testing frameworks. Onboarding takes 3 weeks.

### Current problems:
- Load time: 5.8s (was 2.1s, SLA: 3s)

Mobile-first social platform. 3M MAU. 47 REST endpoints.

### Timeline:
- 2024-09: REST API serving iOS + Android + Web. Designed by founding engineer.
- 2025-01: Mobile team complained about over-fetching. 12 endpoints return
  50+ fields when mobile needs 5-8.
- 2025-03: Backend lead proposed GraphQL. Founding engineer opposed:
  "REST is simpler, just make new endpoints."
- 2025-05: Created 15 new "mobile-optimized" endpoints. Now 62 total.
- 2025-08: Web team started needing different field combinations. Created
  query parameter filters (?fields=id,name,avatar). 8 endpoints support it.
- 2025-11: iOS team needs nested resources (user → posts → comments).
  Currently requires 3 sequential API calls. Created 5 "aggregate" endpoints.
- 2026-02: 67 endpoints. 4 engineers spend 30% of time maintaining endpoint
  variants. API documentation is 200 pages. Founding engineer says
  "this is fine, REST scales linearly."

IoT data processing platform. 50K devices. Backend team of 5.

### Timeline:
- 2024-10: Running on 3 EC2 instances. Stable but "boring" per team lead.
- 2025-01: Team lead attended re:Invent. Came back wanting "full serverless."
  Team agreed — resume-driven development enthusiasm.
- 2025-03: Migrated device registration to Lambda. Worked great.
- 2025-05: Migrated telemetry ingestion to Lambda. Cold starts caused
  3-8 second delays. Added provisioned concurrency ($1,200/month).
- 2025-07: Migrated data processing pipeline to Step Functions + Lambda.
  15-minute Lambda timeout hit on batch processing. Workaround: chunked
  processing with SQS between steps. Added 3 weeks of debugging.
- 2025-09: Migrated analytics aggregation. Hit 6MB payload limit on
  Lambda response. Workaround: S3 intermediate storage + pre-signed URLs.
- 2025-12: Monthly AWS bill went from $450 (EC2) to $3,200 (Lambda +
  provisioned concurrency + Step Functions + SQS + S3 intermediate).
- 2026-01: New requirement: 30-second processing SLA on telemetry.
  Current: 3-8 seconds cold start + 2-5 seconds processing = 5-13 seconds.

- 2024-09: Needed breaking change in /users endpoint. Created /api/v2/users.
  Kept v1 running. Now maintaining two endpoint sets.
- 2025-03: Another breaking change in /projects. Created /api/v3/projects.

Microservices platform. 24 services. Prometheus + Grafana + PagerDuty.

### Timeline:
- 2024-09: Set up monitoring after a major outage. CTO: "monitor everything."
- 2024-12: 847 alert rules across 24 services. On-call engineers getting
  50+ pages per night. 90% are false positives or non-actionable.
- 2025-03: Engineers started acknowledging alerts without investigating.
  "Alert acknowledged" became reflexive, not investigative.
- 2025-06: Real production issue (payment service down) went unnoticed
  for 35 minutes because the on-call engineer was desensitized.
- 2025-09: Added "severity levels" (P1-P4). P1: 12/week, P2: 45/week,
  P3: 200/week, P4: 500/week. Only P1 pages. P2-P4 go to Slack.
- 2025-12: P1 count crept up to 30/week as teams inflated severity to
  "get attention." Slack channel for P2-P4 has 10,000+ unread messages.
- 2026-02: Another missed incident — database failover took 12 minutes
  to detect because it was classified as P2.

  A README typo fix takes 45 minutes to merge.

Django web application. 300K LOC. 10 engineers.

### Timeline:

- 2023-04: Django 3.2 LTS end-of-life announced for April 2024.
  Tech lead: "We'll upgrade after the big launch."
- 2023-12: Big launch done. Tech lead: "We'll upgrade in Q1."
- 2024-04: Django 3.2 LTS expired. Still on 3.2. "Too risky to upgrade
  before the conference demo."
- 2024-09: Django 5.0 released. Skipped 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 entirely.
  Now 3 major versions behind. "The jump is too big."
- 2025-03: Security patch for Django 3.2 — Django project says
  "this is the FINAL patch, upgrade now." Applied patch.
- 2025-09: CVE found in Django 3.2 — no patch available. Workaround:
  monkey-patched the vulnerability in our codebase.

  Lead dev: "ORMs are slow and hide what's happening."

  approved reluctantly: "fine for simple CRUD, but complex queries stay raw."
- 2024-06: 30% SQLAlchemy, 70% raw SQL. New hires prefer SQLAlchemy.
  Lead dev still writes raw SQL for everything.
- 2025-01: Database schema change required updating 127 raw SQL queries
  manually. Took 3 weeks. 4 bugs found in production from missed queries.

- 2025-12: Third schema change needed. Lead dev: "This is fine,
