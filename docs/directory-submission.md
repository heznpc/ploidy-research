# Claude.ai Connectors Directory — submission checklist

Tracking doc for the directory submission path described in
[planning/oauth-integration.md](../planning/oauth-integration.md).
The four preceding OAuth slices shipped the code and tests; this
file captures the artefacts Anthropic's reviewers need alongside
the running server.

Source of truth for the submission process:
[claude.com/docs/connectors/building/submission](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/submission).

## Submission draft

### Name

**Ploidy**

### One-line description

Cross-session multi-agent debate MCP server — same model,
different context depths, better decisions.

### Longer description (≤200 words; draft, needs polish)

Ploidy is a structured-debate protocol implemented as an MCP
server. When you face a design, migration, hiring, or prioritisation
decision, Ploidy runs two or more sessions of the same LLM in
parallel: one session holds the full project context, another
starts from zero. They state positions independently, exchange
targeted challenges, and the server synthesises the result with
explicit confidence scoring and a categorical breakdown (agreement
/ productive disagreement / irreducible disagreement).

The research hypothesis — that *context asymmetry*, not agent
count, is what breaks the martingale curse of homogeneous multi-
agent debate — is documented in the accompanying paper
(`paper/main.tex`, Zenodo DOI pending).

Tools exposed include a one-shot `debate` call, history review
(`ploidy-history`), a live-progress web UI, and a growing set of
decision-stage slash commands (`/spike`, `/review-pr`,
`/architecture`, `/hiring`, ...).

### Categories

- Developer tools
- Research / analysis

### Review account

Create a dedicated OAuth client with label `anthropic-review` and
share the credentials via Anthropic's reviewer-support channel.
Procedure once the server is deployed:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<deploy-url>/register \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "client_name": "Anthropic Review",
        "redirect_uris": [
          "https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback",
          "https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback"
        ]
      }'
```

Response contains the `client_id`; include it in the submission
form. Rotate on approval.

## Pre-submission self-check

Before opening the submission form, run:

- [ ] `curl https://<deploy-url>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` returns a 200 with all four endpoint URLs.
- [ ] `curl https://<deploy-url>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` returns a 200 with the issuer listed.
- [ ] `pytest tests/test_oauth_endpoints.py -q` passes against the deployed build.
- [ ] Privacy policy + TOS reviewed by a human who is not me.
- [ ] Screenshots do not contain internal data or PII.
- [ ] The `debate` tool description reads sensibly when shown alone in the Claude.ai tool picker.
- [ ] Rate limits are set (`PLOIDY_RATE_CAPACITY`, `PLOIDY_RATE_PER_SEC`) so one misbehaving user cannot DoS reviewers.
- [ ] A status page / uptime monitor is linked from the support channel.

## Open questions

1. **Hosting cost model**: Directory acceptance implies the server
   stays reachable. Budget for Fly.io / Cloudflare Workers costs
   under reviewer + early-user load.
2. **Commercial use clause**: current TOS is permissive. Decide
   before submission whether commercial users need a separate tier.
3. **Abuse response playbook**: documented runbook for revoking
   a tenant that sends prohibited content is a reviewer checklist
   item.
