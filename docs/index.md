# Ploidy

**Same model, different context depths, better decisions.**

Ploidy is a structured debate protocol between physically separate sessions of the same LLM with intentionally asymmetric context depths. Unlike multi-model approaches that rely on model diversity, Ploidy exploits **context diversity** within a single model.

The name draws from biological polyploidy, where gene duplication provides redundancy that enables both error tolerance and functional diversification.

## The Problem: Stochastic Prior Lock-in

When you ask the same model the same question in different sessions, you get different answers. If you only use one session, that first stochastic response anchors all subsequent reasoning. Prompt-based mitigations (chain-of-thought, reflection, "think again") have **no statistically significant effect** on this anchoring bias.

A user confined to a single session is unknowingly subject to a stochastic lottery.

## The Mechanism: Context Asymmetry Spectrum

Ploidy introduces a 2D framework for multi-session verification:

| | Passive (in prompt) | Active (on request) | None |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Full context** | Deep | Deep-Active | -- |
| **Compressed** | Semi-Fresh-Passive | Semi-Fresh-Active | -- |
| **None** | -- | -- | Fresh |

Two terminals connect to one Ploidy MCP server. Terminal 1 (Deep) has full project context. Terminal 2 (Fresh) starts clean. They debate through typed semantic actions (`agree`, `challenge`, `propose_alternative`, `synthesize`) before a convergence phase.

## Key Finding: Primacy Anchoring Effect

In factorial ablation experiments across 10 tasks and 11 methods, we identified **information position as the dominant factor** in context delivery:

| Condition | Summary Position | Instruction | Avg Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| SF-Passive | Top | No | 89% |
| SF-Passive+Independent | Top | Yes | 94% |
| **SF-Passive+Bottom** | **Bottom** | No | **100%** |
| SF-Active | Bottom | Yes | 100% |

Moving a compressed summary from the top to the bottom of the prompt improves recall from 89% to 100% (+11pp) -- with no other changes. This is consistent with primacy anchoring effects in human cognition.

    These results are from 10 tasks with single runs per condition. Statistical validation with 30+ tasks and 5+ runs is in progress.

## Architecture

```
Terminal A (Deep)              Terminal B (Fresh)
   | debate/start                | debate/join
   | debate/position             | debate/position
   | debate/challenge            | debate/challenge
   | debate/converge
        |
   Ploidy Server (FastMCP, Streamable HTTP :8765)
        |
   SQLite (WAL, ~/.ploidy/ploidy.db)
```

5-phase protocol: `INDEPENDENT` -> `POSITION` -> `CHALLENGE` -> `CONVERGENCE` -> `COMPLETE`

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install ploidy
ploidy serve  # starts MCP server on :8765
```

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Deep session)
ploidy start "Should we migrate from PostgreSQL to TimescaleDB?"

# Terminal 2 (Fresh session)
ploidy join debate-xxxx
```
